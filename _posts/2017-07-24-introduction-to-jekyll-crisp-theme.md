title: Introduction to Jekyll Crisp Theme
---

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll Crisp Theme is a minimalism theme for Jekyll.

This is a sample post. Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.

To create new post, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
